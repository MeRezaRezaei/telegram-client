# Backup — Encrypted Telegram-Channel Vault

The Phase 4 surface: configured local sets → content-addressed chunks →
Argon2id + secretstream encryption → a private Telegram channel per set
via a dedicated session — manifest-first restore, no server-side index,
and a staleness verifier. `php telegram-client:backup <action>` drives
everything; the offline `memory` driver is the default so nothing touches
the network until you opt in.

> **Warning — passphrase rotation trap.** Dedup keys on the *plaintext*
> chunk hash and the runner reuses the set's salt, so giving an existing
> set a new passphrase does **not** re-encrypt anything: unchanged chunks
> count as already-uploaded (their ciphertext is still sealed under the
> *old* key) and only newly-uploaded uniques use the new key. The channel
> then holds a mixed-key set that **no single passphrase can restore** —
> silent data loss on the next `restore`. To rotate a passphrase: point
> the backup at a **new set id** (new channel, new salt), `run` it fully
> under the new passphrase, `verify --passphrase` it, and only then
> retire the old set/channel.

## How it works

- **One channel per set.** Each backup set gets its own private broadcast
  channel, titled `teleproto-backup:<setId>` (find-or-create on first
  run — no manual provisioning step, though pre-creating the channel with
  that exact title works too). Chunks are force-file documents *named by
  their hash* (caption too); manifests are text messages carrying
  `TBMANIFEST1:` + base64 JSON; the latest manifest wins.
- **Content-addressed chunks.** Files are split at `chunk_size` (default
  4 MiB) and keyed by the sha256 of their plaintext. Identical chunks —
  across files or across runs — upload once: a second unchanged run
  uploads zero (the manifest's `chunk_hashes` seeds the known set, and
  the per-set salt reuse keeps hashes stable).
- **Crypto** (see `VaultCrypto`, ported from the owner's sdd/backup):
  passphrase + 16-byte salt → 32-byte key via **Argon2id13**
  (`crypto_pwhash`, OPSLIMIT/MEMLIMIT MODERATE = 3 passes / 256 MiB);
  each chunk sealed with its own **XChaCha20-Poly1305 secretstream**
  (24-byte header prepended, single push tagged `FINAL`). Any truncation,
  reordering, or tampering fails loud at decrypt time.
- **Manifest-first restore.** The manifest — posted *last* — alone
  describes the set: version, set id, salt, created date, per-file
  `{path, size, chunk list}`, and the unique-chunk index. `restore`
  reads it, derives the key from its salt, fetches/decrypts/reassembles
  every file, and validates all paths (traversal-proof) before writing
  anything. Nothing is indexed server-side; the channel is dumb storage.

## Setup — dedicated session, channel provisioning

The telegram driver uploads through **one dedicated session** (a spare
user account or a bot): back up to a channel that account admins. Do not
reuse your primary poller account — quota and flood-waits then can't
starve ingestion.

1. Export a session string for the dedicated account (teleproto's
   `teleproto:login` or `TeleprotoAuthService`).
2. Register it under `telegram-client.daemon.accounts` (the same shared
   registry the daemon/backfill use) — the backup command resolves its
   scope through that entry (`AccountWorker::buildLiveScope`).
3. Channels are **provisioned automatically on first run**: the vault
   scans dialogs for `teleproto-backup:<setId>` and creates the private
   broadcast channel when missing. Pre-creating channels with that exact
   title is equally fine (the exact-title scan finds it).

## Configuration

```php
// config/telegram-client.php
'backup' => [
    'driver' => env('TELEGRAM_CLIENT_BACKUP_DRIVER', 'memory'), // memory|telegram
    'account' => env('TELEGRAM_CLIENT_BACKUP_ACCOUNT'),         // daemon.accounts account_id (telegram driver)
    'chunk_size' => env('TELEGRAM_CLIENT_BACKUP_CHUNK_SIZE', 4194304),
    'sets' => [
        'default' => [
            'paths' => [base_path('docs'), base_path('database/seeds')],
            'excludes' => ['.git', 'node_modules'],   // substring match on absolute path
        ],
    ],
],
```

`driver => 'memory'` (default) is the offline driver: an in-memory vault
that persists nothing — smoke tests and CI only. Real backups need
`driver => 'telegram'` + `account` pointing at a daemon.accounts entry.

## CLI

```bash
php artisan telegram-client:backup run      --set=default --passphrase='...'
php artisan telegram-client:backup status   --set=default
php artisan telegram-client:backup verify   --set=default --sample=5
php artisan telegram-client:backup verify   --set=default --passphrase='...'   # full integrity
php artisan telegram-client:backup prune    --set=default
php artisan telegram-client:backup restore  --set=default --passphrase='...' --target=/tmp/restore
```

- `run` — scan → chunk → encrypt → dedup → upload uniques → post
  manifest; prints `{uploaded, skipped, files, bytes}`.
- `status` — latest-manifest summary `{files, bytes, chunks, created}`.
- `verify` — availability sampling (below); exits non-zero on problems.
- `prune` — chunk GC (below); keyless, so it is cron-safe like plain
  verify.
- `restore` — manifest-first rebuild into `--target`; fails loud on a
  wrong passphrase (`Decryption failed`).

## Verifier semantics — availability vs integrity

`verify` is deliberately **keyless**: it samples N (default 5, `--sample`)
chunk hashes from the latest manifest, re-downloads each, and counts
`ok` when the chunk arrives non-empty; `missing` counts fetch failures.
Integrity is *not* re-proven here — it is structural: every chunk is a
single-message secretstream sealed `FINAL`, so corruption fails loud at
restore time. This keeps the routine staleness check secret-free (cron-
safe). Pass `--passphrase` to upgrade to `verifyWithKey`: full decrypt +
plaintext sha256 against the content address, with `corrupt` counting
decrypt/hash mismatches.

## Pruner semantics — chunk GC

Files deleted (or changed) between runs drop their chunks out of the new
manifest, but the channel kept them forever — `prune` closes that. The
latest manifest's `chunk_hashes` is the keep-set; `prune` walks every
vault message (the vault lists all via `findMessagesByName('')` — for a
Telegram vault that is `messages.search` with an empty q, which returns
every message, merged with realtime history) and deletes each entry that
is chunk-shaped (exactly 64 lowercase hex chars — a sha256 content
address) yet outside the keep-set. Manifest messages and anything not
chunk-shaped are structurally immune, `delete` is idempotent, and a
repeated prune prints `pruned:0` — safe to cron right after every `run`.
Prints `{scanned, pruned}`; needs no passphrase (chunk names are
plaintext hashes). Note prune only ever sees the LATEST manifest, so run
it after a successful `run` — pruning against a stale manifest would
delete chunks the newest backup still needs (the keep-set comes from the
manifest, so in practice this means: never prune while a run is mid-
flight).

## Security notes

- **Passphrase handling**: `--passphrase=` or env
  `TELEGRAM_CLIENT_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE`; never logged or echoed. Lose it
  and the chunks are unrecoverable by design (Argon2id + AEAD, no
  escrow). The salt is public (manifest), the key never leaves the
  process. Rotating the passphrase means rotating the set id — see the
  rotation trap warning above.
- **No server-side index**: Telegram sees ciphertext blobs, file names
  (hashes), channel titles, and message timing — nothing else. Do not
  put secrets in set names/paths.
- **Channel hygiene**: keep the vault channels private and empty of
  other traffic — the vault scans by title and exact chunk names.
- **Confirm-guess leak (low severity)**: chunk names are sha256 of the
  *plaintext*, so a channel reader holding a byte-exact guess of a
  chunk's content (a known file at a known version) can confirm or deny
  it by looking for that hash among the messages — no key needed. Low
  severity (it needs read access to the private channel plus a precise
  guess, and learns only "present/absent"), but it is one more reason
  vault channels must stay private and third-party-free.

## Limits

- **Chunk size vs upload cap**: premium accounts cap uploads at 4 GB;
  free at 2 GB. At the 4 MiB default a chunk is ~0.1% of the smallest
  cap — irrelevant. Uploads go through teleproto's 512 KB
  `upload.saveFilePart` loop either way.
- **Dedup scope** is per set (salt reuse is the linchpin: same passphrase +
  same salt → same chunk hashes). Different sets don't share chunks.
- **Garbage collection exists but is manual**: chunks that drop out of
  every file list (deleted/changed source files) stay in the channel
  until you run `prune` — it GCs exactly those orphans against the
  latest manifest (see Pruner semantics above). Telegram storage is the
  only cost of delaying it.
- **Telegram-driver coverage**: beyond the offline wiring (fake call
  map), the telegram driver is exercised only by the live-gated smoke
  (`tests/Backup/LiveVaultSmokeTest.php`, skipped unless
  `TELEGRAM_CLIENT_LIVE=1` plus a real session in `../teleproto/.env` or
  the environment) — run it manually before relying on the driver.
- **`memory` driver** never persists — it exists for offline tests.
