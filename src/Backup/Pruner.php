/**
 * Chunk garbage collection (night W1-3, P4-carried M): files deleted
 * between backup runs drop their chunks out of every manifest file
 * list, but the vault kept them forever — a shrinking set never
 * shrank its channel. Prune closes that: given the LATEST manifest's
 * chunk_hashes as the keep-set, every chunk-shaped vault entry outside
 * it is deleted.
 *
 * "Chunk-shaped" is exactly 64 lowercase hex chars (sha256 content
 * addresses as Chunker emits them) — checked with strlen/strspn, no
 * regex (src/ is regex-free by policy). Anything else (manifest
 * messages, foreign traffic) is structurally immune, and delete() on
 * the vault is idempotent, so repeated prunes are no-ops.
 *
 * The inventory walk is duck-typed: a vault exposing listAllEntries()
 * (TelegramVault — an UNCAPPED getHistory pagination, because its
 * findMessagesByName is capped at SEARCH_LIMIT and would hide orphans
 * beyond the newest ~100 messages) gets the full walk; every other
 * VaultInterface implementation (InMemoryVault, test fakes) falls back
 * to findMessagesByName(''), which is already a complete listing.
