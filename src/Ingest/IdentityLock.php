/**
 * Duplicate-anchor guard for identity resolution (P2 M3): two workers
 * resolving the same (account, identity) concurrently can both miss the
 * existing-anchor lookup and each mint an anchor — the identity value
 * lives in per-constructor instance tables, so no single DB unique
 * constraint can back the anchor row itself. Pragmatic serialization in
 * two layers instead:
 *
 *  (a) in-process: a static depth-counted key map. PHP workers are
 *      single-threaded, so the map never blocks — it exists to make
 *      nested (reentrant) acquires of the SAME key legal: a region
 *      re-entered inside one execution (ingestResponse → ingest, or two
 *      nodes of one payload carrying the same identity) must not wedge
 *      on its own key. Reentrancy is a documented choice, depth-counted.
 *
 *  (b) cross-worker: on PostgreSQL, a transaction-scoped advisory lock
 *      taken with raw SQL on the caller's connection INSIDE the caller's
 *      transaction — pg_advisory_xact_lock auto-releases at commit or
 *      rollback, so there is no release path to forget and no orphaned
 *      lock after a crash. Advisory locks are reentrant per session, so
 *      nested acquires within one transaction are also safe. sqlite
 *      (single-writer) and mysql (no advisory locks) are a documented
 *      no-op: callers there rely on the anchor discriminator updates
 *      and content aggregation for eventual convergence.
