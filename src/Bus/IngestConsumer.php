/**
 * The bus consumer (plan Task 2): reads one batch for the shared
 * consumer group from the updates stream and clears it:
 *
 *  - decode failure (poison payload) → re-posted verbatim to the
 *    dead-letter stream and acked — one bad entry never wedges the
 *    group;
 *  - RouteTable match → forwarded verbatim to the target stream and
 *    acked (counted as forwarded);
 *  - no route (the default path) → TelegramClient::ingest into P2
 *    truth under the entry's own account_id, with the optional
 *    onStored hook fired after the row commits.
 *
 * Ingest-path failures get a bounded retry: an entry whose ingest
 * throws (unknown constructor against this build, transient DB
 * hiccup, throwing onStored hook, ...) stays un-acked and is retried
 * on the next consumeOnce() cycle; after self::INGEST_ATTEMPTS
 * consecutive throws it is dead-lettered with reason `ingest-failed`
 * and the error message, then acked — a persistently failing entry
 * can no longer wedge the group, while transient faults still get
 * their retries. The strike counter is per-instance (in-memory, see
 * self::ingestFailures): the long-lived loop/daemon reaches the cap
 * in-process; a fresh process starts the count over, which only
 * delays the dead-letter, never the group's progress.
 *
 * Every handled entry is acked before the batch ends, so a crash
 * mid-batch redelivers at most the un-acked tail.
